//strict and loose equality
//strict equality does not perform type coercion 
//loose equality will perform type conversion on it own





//example

console.log(18=='18');//will be true
console.log(18===18);//will also be true


//conclusion always use === to check equality and not ==
//logical operator and---&&
//or---||
//not --!
