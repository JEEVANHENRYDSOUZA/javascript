//objects are blocks
//traditional oops has
//class -- a class is a blueprint form which we can actually create objects
//class is how our object will work
//when we create an object of a class it is called as an instance of that class
//when can create multiple instance of a class and can have different data but the common thing is that they have the same functionality

//4 fundamentals of class creation
//1.polymorphism---child class can override a method that it inherited from parent class
//2.abstraction--hide details that does not matter
//3.inheritance-- common properties can be accessed from  one class can be accessed from another class
//4.encapsulation--- to keep some methods and some functionality  private to a class,external code cannot access it
